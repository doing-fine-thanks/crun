# C-Run

Run `.c` & `.cpp` files like they are scripts.

Note that you have to set the used compiler to `clang++` or something similar if you want to use `.cpp`.
Also, some basic header-only libraries are included for convenience.
 
Consult the script for any env-var names to set to alter behavior.

### Is This Useful?

No clue.

### Why Did You Do This?

Because I have a paper due and am procrastinating.

### What Do You Plan to Add?

- Better script arg passing.
- To configure the underlying compiler used to run the script.
- A help option.
- Maybe a way to define templates to use any compiled language this way???
