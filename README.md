# C-Run

Run `.c` files like they are scripts.

### Is This Useful?
No clue.

### Why Did You Do This?
Because I have a paper due and am procrastinating. 

### What Do You Plan to Add?
 - The ability to pass args to the `.c` script.
 - To configure the underlying compiler used to run the script.
 - A help option.
 - Maybe a way to define templates to use any compiled language this way???
